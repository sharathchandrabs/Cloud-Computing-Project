## Logistic Regression on Portugese Banking Dataset
#Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a regression model where the dependent variable is categorical. In our project, the dependent variable is binary, hence indicating a Binary Classifier form of logistic regression. In binary classification, the dependent variable can take up only two values, ‘0’ or ‘1’. Such a representation is indicative of tackling problems such as pass/fail, accepted/rejected and so on.

Sigmoid function-
The output vector will only be 0 or 1 i.e. y∈{0,1}. The hypothesis function h(x) must satisfy 0<h(x)<1. In order to map h(x) to the interval (0,1) we use the sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function.
